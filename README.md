This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started
##Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
#FIRST STEP:
# using npm
npm install
# OR using Yarn
yarn

#SECOND STEP
# using npm
npm run android
# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
#FIRST STEP
# using npm
npm install
# OR using Yarn
yarn

#SECOND STEP:
cd ios

#THIRD STEP
pod install

#FOURTH STEP
# using npm
npm run ios
# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
